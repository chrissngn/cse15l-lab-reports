Edit file(use vim commands to navigate file and edit index1 to become index2):
These are some of the commands I used,
`j` and `k` to move down and up, `h` and `l` to move left and right
`x` to delete character the cursor is hovering over
`i` key to insert
`esc` key to go back to normal mode
`:q` to quit
`:wq`to save and quit
